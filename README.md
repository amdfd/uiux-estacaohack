UI/UX Basics Experience & Prototype - Estação Hack, 2020

>> Introduction
This working protype was created as a final project for a UI/UX Basics course taken in 2020. Our challenge was to create an app that would help facilitate a bothersome daily task we had by using the Design Sprint methodology and tools such as Adobe Xd and Figma, as well as resources like Material Design, online color scheme generators and typography guides.


>> The process
• Our Squad consisted of three people, including me, with similar backgrounds: we were all English teachers looking for easier ways to organize our daily tasks, student groups, activities and absences to make our lives easier.
• After we figured out what kind of app we wanted to create, we started drawing on paper some of the screens, how they would link together and how they would be organized for a cleaner view. We also established that our target audience could be anyone from beginner teachers to more experienced ones from varying age groups, so we made sure to focus on a concise way of showing information to better suit our audience and avoid polluting the UI.
• Creating the prototype on Adobe Xd was challenging because of the COVID-19 pandemic which meant we had to work remotely. Our solution was to create a Discord channel where we could talk, share our screens and useful links and assets to be able to finish our project.

>> The results
• After many hours and discussions we were able to create our first working prototype and proudly present it to our mentors and fellow classmates. An interactive link to our project can be found here: https://tinyurl.com/ye27rc5y
